# Getting Started with Go

This repo has simple guides to help you get started with the Go programming language (golang).

## Prerequisites

These guides all assume you have basic familiarity with the command line tools for your OS (Windows, Mac, Linux). All guides except for [Installation](INSTALLING.md) assume you have the Go toolchain installed.

If individual guides have prerequisites of their own, those prerequisites will be listed near the top of the guide.

## Guides

- [Installation](INSTALLING.md) - Getting Go installed or upgraded
- [Modules](MODULES.md) - Creating and understanding Go modules
- [Compiling/Running](COMPILING-RUNNING.md) - Compiling and running Go code
